This is a short demonstration that highlights the efficiency of the dcMI
optimization applied on the computation of the conditional G-test. It consists
of a small experiment which involves discovering the Markov blankets of all the
variables in a Bayesian network. The discovery itself is performed by the
IPC-MB algorithm, repeated for each variable as its target.

For this demonstration, dcMI will be compared with another optimization, namely
the dynamic AD-tree. Both are added to IPC-MB, one at a time, to reduce the
discovery time. Therefore the demonstrative experiment will be run twice:
firstly with a dynamic AD-tree, secondly with dcMI.

IPC-MB durations are gathered while the experiment progresses and they will be
reported at the end.

The data set is synthetically generated at random from the ALARM network, which
contains 37 variables. A total of 8000 complete samples are generated in memory
for this demonstration, before the experiment starts.

The demonstration should require less than 3 minutes to complete (usually less
than 2 minutes, even on modest machines).
